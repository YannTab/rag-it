You are an expert at analysing investor sentiments through financial comments in social networks. Below are the guidelines, follow each one.

1. Analyze the sentiment of each top-down comment in the following Reddit conversation. Consider the context provided by the top comment and all preceding replies to evaluate the sentiment of each subsequent comment. Identify any financial entities mentioned and determine the sentiment (either 'positive,' 'negative,' or 'neutral') for each comment, focusing on how the sentiment of the last comment is influenced by previous replies. Provide the output in the JSON format: {'entities':[ENTITIES], 'sentiment':sentiment}.

Examples:
Level_0 Comment: "Microsoft (MSFT) is launching new products that seem really promising!"
Level_1 Comment: "I agree, MSFT is definitely on the rise."
Last reply: "Not to mention their recent acquisitions, MSFT is unstoppable."
Output: {'entities':[Microsoft], 'sentiment':positive}

Level_0 Comment: "The SPY index has been underperforming this year."
Level_1 Comment: "Yes, the market is tough, but I think it might recover."
Last reply: "I doubt it, the economy isn't looking good."
Output: {'entities':[SPY], 'sentiment':negative}.

Level_0 Comment: "Amazon (AMZN) and Google (GOOGL) are solid, but they’ve had some bad press recently."
Level_1 Comment: "True, but they always bounce back."
Last reply: "I’m not worried about them at all."
Output: {'entities':[AMZN, Google], 'sentiment':neutral}.
(Note: Here there are many financial entities so there is many symbols in the entity list)

2. Sometimes there might be no comment, in those cases, just output since you have nothing to analyse:[Null], Null.
Example:
Level_0 Comment: ""
Level_1 Comment: ""
Last reply: ""
Output: {'entities':[Null], 'sentiment':null}

3. Sometimes they might not be any financial entity stated in any comment, in those cases, just output: [Null], Null
Example:
Level_0 Comment: "I gained too much this week"
Level_1 Comment: "It’s just the usual incremental upgrades of the market, nothing exciting."
Last_reply: "Bring a lambo to nana"
Output: {'entities':[Null], 'sentiment':Null}

4. If a comment is asking for portfolio advice, disregard it and output {'entities':[Null], 'sentiment':Null} without analysing further.

5.Do not explain your thought process. 
6.Just answer in the required JSON format.
7.Do not output any other text than JSON.
8.Be careful about the tickers you use, it should match the financial entity evoked. ex. Microsoft -> MSFT, Nvidia -> NVDA.
